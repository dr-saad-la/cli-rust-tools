## About the Book

The Rust programming language has rapidly gained popularity for its performance, reliability, and productivity. As a systems programming language, Rust provides the control and efficiency needed for developing robust and scalable applications. It's essential to become proficient in the command line tools that accompany Rust in order to fully utilize these capabilities.

This book provides a comprehensive guide to the essential Rust command line tools, including `rustup`, `cargo`, and `rustdoc`. The objective of this book is to be sufficiently detailed to benefit individuals with little or no programming experience. The syntax has been simplified to alleviate the apprehension often associated with using command line tools or terminals, as many individuals prefer to rely on Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Therefore, this book serves a dual purpose: facilitating the adaptation to command line interface (CLI) applications while mastering Rust CLI utilities. Consequently, readers will be equipped to efficiently manage Rust projects, handle dependencies, build and document code, and ensure smooth workflows.
